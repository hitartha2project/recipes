    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large potatoes, peeled</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <p>
          Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in
          potatoes and peas; cook until potatoes are tender but still firm,
          about 15 minutes. Drain, mash together, and set aside.
          <li>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over
              medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds and bay leaf; stir until
              fragrant and seeds are browned. Add ground beef and onions; cook
              until beef is browned and crumbly and onions are soft, about 5 to
              7 minutes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Stir in garlic and ginger. Season with salt, cumin, coriander,
              turmeric, chili powder, cinnamon, cardamom, and black pepper. Stir
              in the mashed potato mixture. Remove from heat and chill in the
              refrigerator for 1 hour, or until cool.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Heat 1 quart of oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mix cilantro and green chile peppers into potato and beef mixture.
              Place approximately 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto each phyllo
              sheet. Fold sheets into triangles, pressing edges together with
              moistened fingers.
            </p>

              Lower samosas carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until
              golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined
              plate to drain. Repeat with remaining samosas. Serve warm.
