    <h2>What Is Naan?</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        Naan (pronounced nahn) is an oven-baked, leavened bread that is stuffed
        and flavored in a variety of ways. An essential part of South and
        Central Asian cuisine, naan is easy, affordable, and makes the most of
        pantry ingredients you already have on hand. Flour, yeast, milk, and
        butter make a tender dough that's simply seasoned with garlic and salt,
        but there is a wide array of naan bread flavors. You'll find everything
        from coconut and raisin-stuffed bread to saucy lamb-topped naan in
        restaurants and home kitchens around the world.
